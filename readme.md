To start the application you just need to open the .jar file by clicking or in the command line:

```
You may need to use root priviliges to execute the file in Linux.

## Usage

### Viewing a remote log

Viewing a remote log is really easy. Open the application and open the Log Viever tab. This tab opens by default. Nextly, fill in your credentials and click connect. If no error are beeing presented to you, you are good to go.

Be advised that you need to have a functional entry in your known hosts file. RLV is **not** capable of creating such an entry. That's why you need to connect to your remote server at least once in your terminal before using RLV.
